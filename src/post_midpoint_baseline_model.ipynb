sent by his master to  engage the services of the reverend samuel wilson in a certain marriage  ceremony which was to take place the next day     passepartout went on his errand enchanted   he soon reached the  clergymans house but found him not at home   passepartout waited a  good twenty minutes and when he left the reverend gentleman it was  thirty five minutes past eight   but in what a state he was  with his  hair in disorder and without his hat he ran along the street as never  man was seen to run before overturning passers by rushing over the  sidewalk like a waterspout     in three minutes he was in saville row again and staggered back into  mr  foggs room     he could not speak     what is the matter asked mr  fogg     my master gasped passepartout  marriage  impossible      impossible    impossible  for to morrow     why so    because to morrow  is sunday    monday replied mr  fogg     no  to day is saturday     saturday  impossible    yes yes yes yes cried

and overturned five carriages reached the  reform club     the clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared in the great  saloon     phileas fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in eighty  days    phileas fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds    how was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made this  error of a day  how came he to think that he had arrived in london on  saturday the twenty first day of december when it was really friday  the twentieth the seventy ninth day only from his departure    the cause of the error is very simple     phileas fogg had without suspecting it gained one day on his journey  and this merely because he had travelled constantly eastward he would  on the contrary have lost a day had he gone in the opposite direction  that is westward     in journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun and the days  therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed  degrees in this direction   there are three hundred and sixty degrees  on the circumference of the earth and these three hundred and sixty  degrees multiplied by four minutes gives precisely twenty four  hours  that is the day unconsciously gained   in other words while  phileas fogg going eastward saw the sun pass the meridian eighty  times his friends in london only saw it pass the meridian seventy nine  times   this is why they awaited him at the reform club on saturday  and not sunday as mr  fogg thought     and passepartouts famous family watch which had always kept london  time would have betrayed this fact if it had marked the days as well  as the hours and the minutes    phileas fogg then had won the twenty thousand pounds but as he had  spent nearly nineteen thousand on the way the pecuniary gain was  small   his object was however to be victorious and not to win  money   he divided the one thousand pounds that remained between  passepartout and the unfortunate fix against whom he cherished no  grudge   he deducted however from passepartouts share the cost of  the gas which had burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty  hours for the sake of regularity     that evening mr  fogg as tranquil and phlegmatic as ever said to  aouda is our marriage still agreeable to you    mr  fogg replied she it is for me to ask that question   you were  ruined but now you are rich again     pardon me madam my fortune belongs to you   if you had not suggested  our marriage my servant would not have gone to the reverend samuel  wilsons i should not have been apprised of my error and      dear mr  fogg said the young woman     dear aouda replied phileas fogg     it need not be said that the marriage took place forty eight hours  after and that passepartout glowing and dazzling gave the bride  away   had he not saved her and was he not entitled to this honour    the next day as soon as it was light passepartout rapped vigorously  at his masters door   mr  fogg opened it and asked whats the  matter passepartout    what is it sir  why ive just this instant found out      what    that we might have made the tour of the world in only seventy eight  days     no doubt returned mr  fogg by not crossing india   but if i had  not crossed india i should not have saved aouda she would not have  been my wife and      mr  fogg quietly shut the door     phileas fogg had won his wager and had made his journey around the  world in eighty days   to do this he had employed every means of  conveyance  steamers railways carriages yachts trading vessels  sledges elephants   the eccentric gentleman had throughout displayed  all his marvellous qualities of coolness and exactitude   but what  then  what had he really gained by all this trouble  what had he  brought back from this long and weary journey    nothing say you  perhaps so nothing but a charming woman who  strange as it may appear made him the happiest of men    truly would you not for less than that make the tour around the world
